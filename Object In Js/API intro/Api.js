// Brief Introduction:- Of  Api

////// API (Application Programming Interface) ////// :- Basically it is a tool.
// => It is a way for two applications or systems to talk to each other and exchange data or service. It acts like a messenger that takes a request, processes it, and returns the result.

// Real-life Example:- restaurants

//=> The Menu(API documentation) is the API  - it shows you what's available. And what you can do with API. Like in menu you can see what foods you can order.
//=> You(the client) make a request(your order) through the waiter(API) --> Waiter is like a actual API tool.
//=> The waiter communicates with the kitchen(The system) to prepare your food(request Or Data)
//=> The kitchen prepare the food(data) and give it to the waiter.
//=> The waiter brings the food(response) back to you.

//// JSON APis /// 
// => we use JSON APIs to get structured response from the backend, making it easy for the frontend to understand and display the data. Json acts as the common languagebetween the client and server.

// Example of JSON syntax:-

// {
//     "key": "values",
//     "anotherKey": 123,
//     "arrayKey": [1,2,3],
//     "Objectkey": { "key": "value"},
//     "boolean": false,
// }


// Online tool to understand JSON :- There are many tools online. we also create our own tool.
// Ex:- Json formatter.  // search it on google.
